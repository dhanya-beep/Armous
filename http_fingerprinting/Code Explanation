This Python script analyzes HTTP request files to detect if they came from:
- Human users(real browsers)
- Traditional bots(scrapers, crawlers)
- AI/LLM bots(ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

1. Known signature lists:
        This code sets up two lists of known bot signatures to look for in User-Agent headers:
          -Traditional bots: Scrapy, curl, python-requests, Selenium, etc.
          -LLM/AI bots: OpenAI, Claude, ChatGPT, GPT, etc.

2. File Parsing:
        Reads your text file and extracts HTTP request information
          - Opens and reads the specified file
          - Looks for the HTTP request line (GET /path HTTP/1.1)
          - Parses headers in "Key: Value" format
          - Tries to find IP addresses in the content
          - Returns a dictionary with all parsed data



3. Entropy Calculation: 
        Measures how "random" or "predictable" text is using Shannon entropy. Many different characters (letters, numbers, symbols, spaces). Uppercases or only lowercases?
          - Human browsers have complex, varied User-Agent strings with lots of version numbers, parentheses, semicolons, and varied text â†’ High entropy
          - Simple bots often have short, predictable User-Agents (low entropy)
          - Lower entropy = more suspicious

4. User-Agent Analysis:
        The main detective work on the User-Agent header
          - Length: Too short = suspicious (bots often have minimal User-Agents)
          - Entropy: Low randomness = suspicious
          - Bot signatures: Direct matches against known bot patterns
          - Browser legitimacy: Does it look like a real browser?
          - Headless detection: Looks for headless browser indicators
          - Missing standard headers: Accept, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding
          - Header count: Too few or too many headers
          - Connection patterns: Unusual connection behaviors
          - Header combinations: Inconsistent header sets

Scoring system:
- Missing User-Agent: +10 points
- Bot signature found: +25 points  
- LLM signature found: +30 points
- Various other suspicious patterns: +5 to +15 points


Classification levels:
-  LLM/AI SCRAPER(HIGH threat): AI bot signatures detected
-  TRADITIONAL BOT(MEDIUM threat): Regular bot signatures or high score
-  SUSPICIOUS (LOW threat): Some suspicious indicators
-  LIKELY HUMAN(NONE): No major red flags
