The system evaluates potential security threats by examining multiple data points and calculating a composite risk score to determine whether to ALLOW, CHALLENGE, or BLOCK incoming requests.
Key Components
1. Multi-Source Threat Intelligence
The engine integrates with several real threat intelligence APIs:
      AbuseIPDB - Checks IP reputation and abuse confidence
      VirusTotal - Scans IPs and URLs against multiple antivirus engines
      AlienVault OTX - Analyzes domain reputation using threat pulse data
      Shodan - Examines open ports and service information

2. Risk Assessment Categories
The system analyzes six different threat vectors:
      IP Reputation: Checks if the IP has a history of malicious activity
      URL/Domain Analysis: Scans for known malicious websites
      User-Agent Inspection: Identifies bot traffic and suspicious tools
      Behavioral Patterns: Detects unusual request frequencies and burst patterns
      Port/Service Analysis: Identifies suspicious open services
      Historical Data: Tracks request patterns over time

3. Scoring System
      Each category contributes points to a total risk score
      Scores are weighted based on threat severity
      Final scores map to actions:
      
      0-3: ALLOW (safe traffic)
      4-7: CHALLENGE (suspicious, may require additional verification)
      8+: BLOCK (high risk, likely malicious)


Example Workflow

      An incoming request arrives with IP 185.220.101.32
      The system queries multiple threat intelligence APIs
      Results show it's a known Tor exit node with medium abuse confidence
      User-agent analysis reveals automated tool usage
      Behavioral analysis shows burst request patterns
      Total score: 12 â†’ BLOCK decision

The code essentially creates an automated security analyst that makes real-time decisions about whether network traffic should be trusted or blocked based on comprehensive threat intelligence data.
